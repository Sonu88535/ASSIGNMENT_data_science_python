    "# Q1- What is an Exception python? Write the difference between Exception and Syntax errors.\n",
    "# Ans_\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution\n",
    "# of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.\n",
    "# When a Python script encounters a situation it cannot cope with, it raises an exception.\n",
    "# Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as incorrect user input, file not found, division by zero, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when you make a mistake in the syntax of your code. \n",
    "# These errors prevent the program from running and are detected by the Python interpreter before\n",
    "# the program starts executing. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons at the end of \n",
    "# statements, mismatched parentheses, and misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1-Timing of Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "#         Exception:\n",
    "#             Detected during the program's execution when a specific condition is met.\n",
    "#         Syntax Error:\n",
    "#             Detected before the program starts running, during the parsing phase.\n",
    "# 2-Cause:\n",
    "#         Exception:\n",
    "#             Caused by runtime conditions, such as invalid user input or attempting to access an index that is out of bounds.\n",
    "#         Syntax Error:\n",
    "#             Caused by mistakes in the code structure or syntax, such as missing colons or parentheses.\n",
    "# 3-Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "#         Exception:\n",
    "#             Can be handled using try-except blocks. You can catch and respond to\n",
    "#             exceptions to prevent the program from terminating abruptly.\n",
    "#         Syntax Error:\n",
    "#             Must be fixed before the program runs. The interpreter won't execute the code until syntax errors are corrected.\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception: ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, IndexError, etc.\n",
    "# Syntax Error: Missing colons, mismatched parentheses, misspelled keywords, etc."
